## Reproducibility

### please add a README file that describes: your goals, what naming system and structure you will follow
## Goal:The dataset includes mRNA sequencing data from adult hearts of zebrafish, lamprey, and sea squirt, combined with RNA-Seq data from 11 other vertebrate species. The analysis aims to investigate the evolutionary contribution of gene and genome duplications to heart structure development, focusing on how the number of heart-expressed duplicate genes correlates with increasing heart chamber complexity across vertebrate phylogeny.
## Naming system:
(1)Use English for all names.
(2)Use lowercase letters with words separated by underscores maintain consistency.
(3)Use the YYYY-MM-DD format for chronological sorting.
(4)Use version numbers as _vX.X (e.g., _v1.0).)
(5)Ensure folder names clearly reflect the task or project module.
(6)Organize files into a workflow using numbers.

## Structure:
(1)Create a separate top-level folder for each project or task.
(2)Organize subfolders within the project folder based on data, analysis, documents, etc.

For example:
```
project_name/                # Project root directory
├── data/                    # Data folder
│   ├── raw/                 # Raw data
│   ├── processed/           # Processed data
│   └── metadata/            # Data description files
├── analysis/                # Data analysis folder
│   ├── scripts/             # Analysis scripts
│   ├── notebooks/           # Jupyter notebooks
│   └── results/             # Analysis results
├── documents/               # Document folder
│   ├── drafts/              # Draft documents
│   ├── reports/             # Final reports
│   └── literature/          # Literature references
├── resources/               # Resource folder
│   └── references/          # Reference materials
└── README.md                # Project description file
```
