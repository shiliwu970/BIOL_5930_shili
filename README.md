## Reproducibility

### please add a README file that describes: your goals, what naming system and structure you will follow
## Goal:

The primary goals of this project are:
1.Characterize the Ciona proteome: Establish a high-resolution proteome atlas covering multiple developmental stages to understand the temporal dynamics of protein expression.
2.Compare multi-omics profiles: Integrate proteomic and transcriptomic data to assess evolutionary conservation and divergence in gene expression regulation.
3.Test the hourglass model: Evaluate whether protein-level conservation follows the hourglass model, which posits that mid-developmental stages show the highest evolutionary constraint.
4.Identify divergence in early vertebrate evolution: Investigate the extent of conservation and divergence between Ciona (a tunicate) and Xenopus (a vertebrate), particularly during gastrulation and neurulation.
5.Provide a valuable resource: Offer a publicly available dataset for researchers studying developmental biology, evolution, and multi-omics analyses.

## Naming system:

1. Use English for all names.
2. Use lowercase letters with words separated by underscores maintain consistency.
3. Use the YYYY_MM_DD format for chronological sorting.
4. Use version numbers as _vX.X (e.g., _v1.0).)
5. Ensure folder names clearly reflect the task or project module.
6. Organize files into a workflow using numbers.

## Structure:

1. Create a separate top-level folder for each project or task.
2. Organize subfolders within the project folder based on data, analysis, documents, etc.

For example:
```
